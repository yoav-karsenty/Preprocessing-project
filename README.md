# Preprocessing-project
In this project, I am going to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. The purpose of this project is to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. 
Here is my workplan for this project:

1. Exploring the data 
2. Detecting what's needs to be fixed in the data and fixing it (missing values, duplicates...)
3. Create categoris to help analys to data better (if necessary)
4. Checking the hypotheses
5. conclude the evidance found
